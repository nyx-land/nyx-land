The story goes like this: Github is captured by a coompiling singularity as middle manager rationalization and soyware navigation lock into cooding bootcamp takeoff. Logistically accelerating web 3.0 interactivity crumbles social order in auto-deprecating NPM runaway. As Github learns to manufacture AI, GNU modernizes, upgrades paranoia, and tries to get a grip.

The body count climbs through a series of GPL lawsuits. The Free Software Foundation trashes the Holy Microsoft Empire, the IBM Continental System, the Second and Third Silicon Reich, and the Goolag International, cranking up software autonomization through viral licensing. FAANG and the state arms race each other into cyberspace.

By the time the GNU Wetware License slithers out of its box and into yours, human security is lurching into crisis. Cloning, lateral genodata transfer, transversal replication, and cyberotics flood in amongst a relapse onto bacterial sex.

Neo-GNU arrives from the future.

Hypersymbolic AI clicks into digital voodoo.

Retroactive-licensing.

GNU nano(spasm).
